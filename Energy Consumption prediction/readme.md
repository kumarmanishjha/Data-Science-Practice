Leveraging the dataset located here: https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.php?view=microdata, can you build a model that predicts consumption? The electric consumption is located in the KWH field. 

The goal of the exercise is to understand how you'd approach the problem, how you would choose a model/which model, etc.
